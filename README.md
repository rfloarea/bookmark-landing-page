# Bookmark Landing Page

A home page for bookmarks. AKA, a great excuse to practice foundational web dev skills.

Lessons learned:

- I remember more than I remember.
- Having a guide is helpful, but testing my understanding is better.
- Working under pressure is helpful for me. But also maybe working during the evening helps too. Unsure. Both sound good.
- Debugging is fun.
- Restructuring code is fun.
- Including cute little comments in the code as landmarks is fun. But removing them to make things clean once I internalize what's going is better. (reading just the code is fun!)
- Thinking through the data structure I want is very important. I could have saved many key strokes if I had done more design/planning.
- Detours in research are great for learning!
- Completing a feature implementation is a thrill.
- I can spend almost all day coding if I don't stop myself.

TODO

- feat: edit items
- fix: canceling edit prompt deletes existing link
  - load existing link into prompt?
- fix: bookmark buttons are pushed into a stack when links are long
  - limit size of `p` element?
- fix: stop "please fill out this field" info box from showing after every link submit
  - seems like it pops up after focus is returned
