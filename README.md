# Bookmark Landing Page

A home page for bookmarks. AKA, another excuse to practice web dev skills.

Time spent: 217 minutes (3.6 hours)

Things learned:

- I remember more than I remember.
- Having a guide is helpful, but testing my understanding is better.
- Working under pressure is helpful for me. But also maybe working during the evening helps too. Unsure. Both sound good.
- Debugging is fun.
- Restructuring code is fun.
- Including cute little comments in the code as landmarks is fun.

TODO

- feat: implement storage of some kind
- fix: canceling edit prompt deletes existing link
  - load existing link into prompt?
- fix: bookmark buttons are pushed into a stack when links are long
  - limit size of `p` element?
- fix: stop "please fill out this field" info box from showing after every link submit
  - seems like it pops up after focus is returned
