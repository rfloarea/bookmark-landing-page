# Bookmark Landing Page

A home page for bookmarks. AKA, another excuse to practice web dev skills.

Time spent: 70 minutes

Things learned:

- I remember more than I remember.
- Having a guide is helpful, but testing my understanding is better.
- Working under pressure is helpful for me. But also maybe working at night helps too. Unsure. Both sound good.
